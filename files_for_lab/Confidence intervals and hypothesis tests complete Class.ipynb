    "When we work with a dataset, we need to keep in mind that in fact we're working with a **sample** of the real **population**. Therefore, any statistic (mean, sd,...etc) that we can compute from our **sample** it will not have the same value as the statistic of the real **population**. It will be a single **estimation** and it will be off by a centain unknown amount called **sampling error**. Furthermore, if we wait until we have more data or we simply pick another dataset from a different source of data and we compute the same statistic we will get a different value because our **sample** will be different. Thus, in general them mean of our sample will not be the same as the mean of the population:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(sample\\_mean=\\bar{x}) \\neq (population\\_mean=\\mu)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\bar{x} + \\delta(n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta$ is the **sampling error** that will be different for each sample.This **sampling error** will depend on the **sample size** $n$. The bigger the sample, the smaller the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, could be a bit dissapointing as we don't have any way to determine how big is going to be the **sampling error**. To get a better idea of what could be the real **population mean** we could collect several samples and compute their corresponding **sample means**. Each sample mean will be off by an unknown amount and we might think that we are in the sample place where we started. However, we could make use of the **central limit theorem** and compute **the mean of several sample means** to get a more reliable **estimation**. But this strategy takes time and/or money and we might mot be able to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, what else we can do? We can use the **central limit theorem** in our favour. What this theorem says is that the **sampling distribution** (the distribtuion followed by the means of our samples) follows a **normal distribution** regardeless of the original **population distribution**. In other words, if we could be able to collect many samples and to compute the mean of each of sample, when we will plot the distribution followed by these **sample means**, we will find a normal distribution centered on the **population mean**. Therefore, if we substract the population mean from our sample mean, the resulting value will be a random value that will follow a **normal distribution** centered on zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x}-\\mu = -\\delta(n) = ùí©(0,œÉ)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "if we divide both sides of the equation by the population's standard deviation we will have a normal distribution with $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma=1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\frac{(\\bar{x}-\\mu)}{\\sigma}= -\\frac{\\delta(n)}{\\sigma} = ùí©(0,1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not allways we will know the population's standard deviation $\\sigma$ but we can have a reliable estimation using our sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma ‚âà \\hat{\\sigma}=\\sqrt{ \\sum \\frac{(x - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1} }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know the $ùí©(0,1)$ distribution we can use it to provide a range of values around our sample mean that very likely will contain the real **population value**. The idea is then to take one sample, compute our sample mean $\\bar{x}$, and then provide a range of values around our sample mean $\\bar{x}$ that very likely will contain the real population mean. How likely? As much as we want: 90%, 95%, 98%..."
